ROUGH README

This project allows users to communicate within Whatsapp to store and retrieve any exercise they have done at the gym, with the data stored in a PSQL database. The project allows users
to see the weight and reps completed for an exercise, and access an API which can suggest new exercises to complete.

LOGIC

The communication aspect is done via having Whatsapp running on your PC and having a pinned chat called Gym, with just you being the only member. 
The Python script uses selenium to communicate through the web, which you can then answer with from your mobile phone.
